Welcome to Bob's Mighty MIDI Site ! I hope you enjoy my site.  MIDI stands for "Musical Instrument Digital Interface" and is simply a type of sound file that can be played on a computer or across the Internet.
I've included my favorite orignal MIDI's that I have composed myself.
1.) The arrangements are heavy with bass and drums, so you might have to tweak them to your liking.  They were all optimized for either a Turtle Beach Montego II, or Sound Blaster soundcard.  But regardless of what sound card you have, a good set of speakers and a sub woofer are necessary to hear the full effects of MIDI.
2.) My original compositions can be downloaded intact.  Feel free to use them as you wish. They make great background music for web sites. And if you want just simple music, I've included a collection of original background rhythms that do not contain any melody.
3.) MIDI's will be added frequently, so please check back again !
